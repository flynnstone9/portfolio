features to add:
    tmrws coding goals:
    2. start work on joey's ui - spend more time here
    
    
    8. normal font bigger on desktop
    5. width for desktop needs to be narrowed and menu aligned to narrowed width (see.medium.c)
    5a. width of bottom section on mobile too narrow
    
    9. link selecteed dashed thorugh fucked up on everything except portfolio because had to copy nav
   
     11. change url name
     
     
minor updates/fixes
1. nav back button loading ontop of title as page loads in
2. the nav open is taking the back page to the top for some reason...? (due to frozen postion in js)
3. v1 on mobile nav?
4. consider adding the animation back to the desktop nave (just remove none if you can get it to only happen once, the first load of page)
5. for the Images.html add - on other side of bottom descirtion add tools used to create - maybe like a tag with an icon 

    
bugs: 
    1. for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(
    2. 
    
    
todo after main work is done: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed
    google anlytics scrpts?



stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
4. breaking it all out in little junks, is the only way to get it done for me
5. thinking mobile was helpful 

content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???

a thought: after core website is done - just add a feature a day... will make it easier and let's me do other stuff during the day... 

look into sass - preprocessors - setting up projects with an init
