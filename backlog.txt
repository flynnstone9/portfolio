features to add:
    
    card title need heiarchy
    consider top hero part
    
    next link on project
    open images lightbox (model)
    animations
    
    
    v.1 in the menu nave
    icons for skill secton
    10. for the Images.html add - on other side of bottom descirtion add tools used to create - maybe like a tag with an icon

    
bugs: 
    for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(    
    
    
todo after main work is done: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed



stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
4. breaking it all out in little junks, is the only way to get it done for me
5. thinking mobile was helpful 

content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???

a thought: after core website is done - just add a feature a day... will make it easier and let's me do other stuff during the day... 

look into sass - preprocessors - setting up projects with an init





to get enlarge working - need to add script DOM ready to each page 
add actual script at bottom 

fuck this try moving scripts to a folder
