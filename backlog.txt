features to add:
    tmrws coding goals:
    3. icons for skill secton
    4. for the Images.html add - on other side of bottom descirtion add tools used to create - maybe like a tag with an icon 
    4b. plus vsco images
    5. start work on joey's ui - spend more time here
    
    
    1. gallerique mobile x-axis not frozen and image do not have the contentwidth margin
    1.card title need heiarchy
    5. width for desktop needs to be narrowed and menu aligned to narrowed width (see.medium.c)
    5a. width of bottom section on mobile too narrow
    # consider adding the animation back to the desktop nave (just remove none if you can get it to only happen once, the first load of page)
    8. normal font bigger on desktop
    9. link selecteed dashed thorugh fucked up on everything except portfolio because had to copy nav
    10. v1 on mobile nav?
    
     10. get copy perfect
     11. change url name

    
bugs: 
    1. for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(
    2. 
    
    
todo after main work is done: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed
    google anlytics scrpts?



stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
4. breaking it all out in little junks, is the only way to get it done for me
5. thinking mobile was helpful 

content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???

a thought: after core website is done - just add a feature a day... will make it easier and let's me do other stuff during the day... 

look into sass - preprocessors - setting up projects with an init
