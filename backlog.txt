features to add:
    
    1.card title need heiarchy
    2.next link on project
    
    3.animations
    3a. close button on mobile menu
    
    4. x-axis frozen and menu frozen only working on portfolio page? 
    
    5. width for desktop needs to be narrowed and menu aligned to narrowed width (see.medium.c)
    5a. width of bottom section on mobile too narrow
    5b. project and part of image should be shown mobile
    
    6. v.1 in the menu nave
    7. icons for skill secton
    8. normal font bigger on desktop
     for the Images.html add - on other side of bottom descirtion add tools used to create - maybe like a tag with an icon

    
bugs: 
    for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(    
    
    
todo after main work is done: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed



stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
4. breaking it all out in little junks, is the only way to get it done for me
5. thinking mobile was helpful 

content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???

a thought: after core website is done - just add a feature a day... will make it easier and let's me do other stuff during the day... 

look into sass - preprocessors - setting up projects with an init
