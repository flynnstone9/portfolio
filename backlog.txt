features to add:
1. open images lightbox (model)
2. desktop nav
3. for the Images.html add - on other side of bottom descirtion add tools used to create
Iphone
PS 
Illustrator

Sony A6300
PS
IL


stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
