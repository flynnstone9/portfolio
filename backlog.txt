bugs: 
    1. for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(
    2. 
    
    
todo after main work is done: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed
    google anlytics scrpts?



stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages
4. breaking it all out in little junks, is the only way to get it done for me
5. thinking mobile was helpful 

content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???

a thought: after core website is done - just add a feature a day... will make it easier and let's me do other stuff during the day... 

look into sass - preprocessors - setting up projects with an init
