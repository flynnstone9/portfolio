    todo: 
    gothrough that reddit web dev frontend checklist
    look at that sites head tag for any other meta tags needed





bugs: 
    for desktop, click "contact" in nav gets rid of nav bar with one or two clicks :(






stuff i'm learning:
1. have components styled before starting process
2. plan mobile and desktop design before hand
3. modular (views) is a better approach - if you change nav it updates on all pages






content-width stylpe 
the stretch of elements inside the container
but only working on mobile and smaller sizes???
